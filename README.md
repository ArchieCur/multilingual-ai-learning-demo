This project is a Storyline GenAI Assistant with language capability.  It is a pipeline that takes pdf input text,
automatically marks it down, then generates keywords and inserts the keywords before chunking.  
The next step is using using RAG and Genai language to allow a user to ask a question from the instructional
content input in their native language.  The process will detect the language, translate that question into the language
the instructional content was written in, query the instructional content, retrieve the answer and 
translate it back to the detected language before presenting the answer to the user. The user never has to leave the course
to consult the manual or textbook and can ask questions in their prefered language. Instructional content
only has to be written in one language.
8 languages are currently enabled.
